                    	<strong>A progress log is used as part of the induction framework to help workers and managers keep a record of the learning outcomes achieved.</strong>
                        <strong>In this app the progress log is a checklist of all the expected learning outcomes that workers can tick to keep track of the learning they have achieved.</strong>

                    	<strong>How to use the progress log</strong>
                        <p>When a learning outcome has been completed, check the box next to it.</p>
                        <p>This app helps you track your progress in completing your social care induction framework if you’re away from the office or out and about. It does not allow you to complete the detail of your induction, but you can check on what you need to do and tick those sections you’ve already done.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You can then save the record of your progress as a PDF and e-mail it to yourself or your manager. If you already have evidence of prior learning or skills covering the learning outcome, these should be recorded.  If you have evidence like certificates / qualifications, include the name of the awarding organisation and the date you achieved them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To complete the progress successfully a manager or an appropriate member of staff must assess the evidence of the learning achieved.  This must be done using a hard copy web based copy of the progress log.</p>

                        	<li>This can be done by a manager, supervisor or an appropriate member of staff.</li>
                            <li>If you already have appropriate evidence of prior learning please state here the title of the certificate / qualification, the name of the awarding organisation and the date you achieved the award.</li>
