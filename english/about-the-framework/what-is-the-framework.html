                    	<strong>Induction is the introduction to social care practice and as such applies to all staff working in social care.</strong>
                        <p>The Social Care Induction Framework (SCIF) for Wales supports a common understanding to induction in social care in Wales. The SCIF sets out learning outcomes that new workers joining the social care sector or a new organisation, or starting a different role should meet in their first 12 weeks of employment.</p>

                        	<li>Provides an opportunity to acquire, develop and strengthen knowledge, skills and understanding essential to social care practice</li>
                            <li>Prepares workers for new and changing roles and responsibilities</li>
                            <li>Gathers evidence that can be used towards future appropriate qualifications</li>
                            <li>Can be used to register residential child care workers if they have yet to achieve the required qualification</li>

                        <p>The SCIF has six common Learning Objectives for new workers in the social care sector. Learning Objective 7 is specifically for those working with children and young people and Learning Objective 8 for those working with adults. Learning Objective 7 or 8 should be completed in addition to the six common Learning Objectives.</p>
